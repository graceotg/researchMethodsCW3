	abstract = {Recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs) has attracted growing interest due to steady progress in handwriting recognition techniques and the rapid emergence of pen- and touch-based devices. Math formula recognition may be understood as a generalization of text recognition: formulas represent mathematical statements using a two dimensional arrangement of symbols on writing lines that are organized hierarchically. This survey provides an overview of techniques published in the last decade, including those taking input from handwritten strokes (i.e., ‘online’, as captured by a pen/touch device), raster images (i.e., ‘offline,’ from pixels), or both. Traditionally, HMEs were recognized by performing four structural pattern recognition tasks in separate steps: (1) symbol segmentation, (2) symbol classification, (3) spatial relationship classification, and (4) structural analysis, which identifies the arrangement of symbols on writing lines (e.g., in a Symbol Layout Tree (SLT) or LaTeX string). Recently, encoder–decoder neural network models and Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches have greatly increased HME recognition accuracy. These newer approaches perform all recognition tasks simultaneously, and utilize contextual features across tasks (e.g., using neural self-attention models). We also discuss evaluation techniques and benchmarks, and explore some implicit dependencies among the four key recognition tasks. Finally, we identify limitations of current systems, and present suggestions for future work, such as using two-dimensional language models rather than the one-dimensional models commonly used in encoder–decoder models.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the 5th Competition on Recognition of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (CROHME). As in previous years, the main task is formula recognition from handwritten strokes (Task 1). Additional tasks include classiﬁcation of isolated symbols (Task 2a), classiﬁcation of isolated valid and invalid symbols (Task 2b), a new task on parsing formula structure from valid handwritten symbols (Task 3), and parsing expressions with matrices (Task 4, experimental). In total, eleven (11) research labs registered for the competition, with six (6) teams submitting results. Innovations for this CROHME included providing a corpus of formulae from Wikipedia to train language models, and an online system for result submission. The highest recognition rates were obtained by MyScript corporation (Task 1. 67.65\%, 2a. 92.81\%, 2b. 86.77\%, 3. 84.38\%, and 4. 68.40\%). Using only provided training data, the highest recognition rates were obtained by WIRIS corporation (Task 1. 49.61\%, Task 3. 78.80\%, Task 4. 56.40\%), the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (Task 2a. 92.28\%), and RIT (Task 2b. 83.34\%). The competition results suggest that recognition of handwritten formulae remains a difﬁcult structural pattern recognition task.},

The character data set suitable for recognizing postal addresses contains 38 elements which include 26 alphabets, 10 numerals and 2 symbols. Fifteen different handwritten data sets were used for training the neural network for classification and recognition of the characters. Three different orientations, namely, horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions are used for extracting 54 features from each character. The trained neural recognition system is tested for various inputs and found to perform well. The diagonal orientation for feature extraction is identified to be the most suitable method as it yields higher recognition accuracy. The proposed system will aid applications for postal/parcel address recognition and conversion of any hand written document into structural text form.},

	abstract = {Handwritten Word Recognition and Spotting is a challenging ﬁeld dealing with handwritten text possessing irregular and complex shapes. The design of deep neural network models makes it necessary to extend training datasets in order to introduce variations and increase the number of samples; word-retrieval is therefore very difﬁcult in low-resource scripts. Much of the existing literature comprises preprocessing strategies which are seldom sufﬁcient to cover all possible variations. We propose the Adversarial Feature Deformation Module (AFDM) that learns ways to elastically warp extracted features in a scalable manner. The AFDM is inserted between intermediate layers and trained alternatively with the original framework, boosting its capability to better learn highly informative features rather than trivial ones. We test our meta-framework, which is built on top of popular word-spotting and wordrecognition frameworks and enhanced by the AFDM, not only on extensive Latin word datasets but also sparser Indic scripts. We record results for varying training data sizes, and observe that our enhanced network generalizes much better in the low-data regime; the overall word-error rates and mAP scores are observed to improve as well.},

	abstract = {Due to increased usage of digital technologies in all sectors and in almost all day to day activities to store and pass information, Handwriting character recognition has become a popular subject of research. Handwriting remains relevant, but people still want to have Handwriting copies converted into electronic copies that can be communicated and stored electronically. Handwriting character recognition refers to the computer's ability to detect and interpret intelligible Handwriting input from Handwriting sources such as touch screens, photographs, paper documents, and other sources. Handwriting characters remain complex since different individuals have different handwriting styles. This paper aims to report the development of a Handwriting character recognition system that will be used to read students and lectures Handwriting notes. The development is based on an artificial neural network, which is a field of study in artificial intelligence. Different techniques and methods are used to develop a Handwriting character recognition system. However, few of them focus on neural networks. The use of neural networks for recognizing Handwriting characters is more efficient and robust compared with other computing techniques. The paper also outlines the methodology, design, and architecture of the Handwriting character recognition system and testing and results of the system development. The aim is to demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks for Handwriting character recognition.},

	abstract = {Traditional systems of handwriting recognition have relied on handcrafted features and a large amount of prior knowledge. Training an Optical character recognition (OCR) system based on these prerequisites is a challenging task. Research in the handwriting recognition ﬁeld is focused around deep learning techniques and has achieved breakthrough performance in the last few years. Still, the rapid growth in the amount of handwritten data and the availability of massive processing power demands improvement in recognition accuracy and deserves further investigation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are very eﬀective in perceiving the structure of handwritten characters/words in ways that help in automatic extraction of distinct features and make CNN the most suitable approach for solving handwriting recognition problems. Our aim in the proposed work is to explore the various design options like number of layers, stride size, receptive ﬁeld, kernel size, padding and dilution for CNN-based handwritten digit recognition. In addition, we aim to evaluate various SGD optimization algorithms in improving the performance of handwritten digit recognition. A network’s recognition accuracy increases by incorporating ensemble architecture. Here, our objective is to achieve comparable accuracy by using a pure CNN architecture without ensemble architecture, as ensemble architectures introduce increased computational cost and high testing complexity. Thus, a CNN architecture is proposed in order to achieve accuracy even better than that of ensemble architectures, along with reduced operational complexity and cost. Moreover, we also present an appropriate combination of learning parameters in designing a CNN that leads us to reach a new absolute record in classifying MNIST handwritten digits. We carried out extensive experiments and achieved a recognition accuracy of 99.87\% for a MNIST dataset.},

Handwriting recognition pose a complexity challenge due to the diversity in handwriting styles among different individuals especially in real time applications. In this paper, an automatic system was designed to handwriting recognition using the recent artificial intelligent algorithms, the conventional neural network (CNN). Different CNN models were tested and modified to produce a system has two important features high performance accuracy and less testing time. These features are the most important factors for real time applications.
